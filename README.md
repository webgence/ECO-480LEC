ECO 480LEC - Econometrics I


The objective of this class is to instruct students in the economic applications of multivariate linear regression models using actual data. Conceptual understanding is stressed, rather than the mechanics of procedures. Topics include panel data, nonlinear regression functions, omitted variable bias, causal inference, using various models to analyze data, and critical assessment of studies that use these models. Emphasis is given to estimating econometric models using economic data. This is done using Stata, a computer statistical package.
